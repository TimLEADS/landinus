# Market Intelligence & Transparency Layer - Complete

## Overview

The Market Intelligence feature transforms Land in US from a lead company into **quiet infrastructure for real estate opportunity**. This system proves relevance without hype, shows activity without exposing data, and builds authority without testimonials.

## Components Created

### 1. Market Temperature Index (`MarketTemperatureCard.tsx`)
- **National Market Pulse**: Large gauge showing overall market temperature
- **State-Level Pulse**: Grid of state-level indicators with trend icons
- **County-Level**: When available, shows granular market signals
- **Visual Design**: Soft sage/slate gradients, calm gauge visualization
- **Data Philosophy**: Trends only, no hard numbers

### 2. Intent Flow Activity (`IntentFlowStream.tsx`)
- **Anonymous Feed**: Slow-updating stream of directional signals
- **No Timestamps**: Reduces pressure, focuses on direction
- **Calm Motion**: Signals appear gradually every 3 seconds
- **Examples**: "Buyer intent increased in Phoenix", "Seller hesitation rising in Austin"

### 3. Market Shift Explainer (`MarketShiftExplainer.tsx`)

### 5. Agent Advantage Window (`AdvantageWindow.tsx`)
